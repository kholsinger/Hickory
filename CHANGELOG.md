## 18 October 2020

- Added estimate of within-population inbreeding coefficient by locus
  and population. NOTE: Each population locus combination is analyzed
  independently.
  
- Included summary of within-population inbreeding coefficient
  analysis to identify locus/population combinations in which the
  estimated credible interval (95% by default) for the
  within-population inbreeding coefficient does not include 0.  
  
- Updated Roadmap. Defer investigation of dominant markers until after
  other tasks are complete.
